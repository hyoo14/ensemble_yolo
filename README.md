# Ensemble Yolo

This project implements an ensemble-based approach for vehicle detection, classification, and counting using YOLO models. The method integrates YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10 to enhance detection accuracy and robustness.





## Overview

Deep learning-based object detection models, such as YOLO, perform well in real-time vehicle detection but may suffer from false positives or missed detections. This project employs an ensemble strategy that merges predictions from multiple YOLO models using an **Intersection over Union (IoU)-based fusion technique**, improving recall and reducing detection errors.

## Methodology

1. **YOLO Model Selection & Inference**  
   - Utilizes YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10, pre-trained on the COCO dataset.
   - Each model generates bounding boxes with confidence scores.

2. **Ensemble Strategy**  
   - Merges overlapping detections using an IoU threshold (Ï„=0.5).
   - Averages bounding box coordinates while retaining the highest confidence score.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** Measures detection accuracy.
   - **F1-score:** Balances precision and recall.
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Evaluates vehicle counting accuracy.

## Results

The ensemble model **outperforms individual YOLO nano models** in F1-score and MAE, demonstrating improved robustness with COCO 2017 validation dataset:

| Model  | Precision | Recall  | F1-score | MAE (Vehicle Count) |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|------------------|
| YOLOv5  | 1.0000   | 0.8576 | 0.8576  | 1.7809 |
| YOLOv8  | 1.0000   | 0.7773 | 0.8576  | 1.7809 |
| YOLOv10 | 1.0000   | 0.7287 | 0.8576  | 1.9560 |
| **Ensemble** | 1.0000   | 0.8148 | **0.8980**  | **1.6609** |

The ensemble model achieves the **highest recall and F1-score**, minimizing false negatives while improving vehicle counting accuracy.

## Dataset
